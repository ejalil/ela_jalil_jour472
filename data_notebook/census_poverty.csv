"3 The 2014 CPS ASEC included redesigned questions for income and health insurance coverage. All of the approximately 98,000 addresses were eligible to receive the redesigned set of health insurance coverage questions. The redesigned income questions were implemented to a subsample of these 98,000 addresses using a probability split panel design. Approximately 68,000 addresses were eligible to receive a set of income questions similar to those used in the 2013 CPS ASEC and the remaining 30,000 addresses were eligible to receive the redesigned income questions. The source of these 2013 estimates is the portion of the CPS ASEC sample that received the redesigned income questions, approximately 30,000 addresses.",,,,,,,,,,,,

"23 Beginning with the 2003 CPS ASEC, respondents were allowed to choose one or more races. White alone refers to people who reported White and did not report any other race category. The use of this single-race population does not imply that it is the preferred method of presenting or analyzing the data. The Census Bureau uses a variety of approaches.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"24 For the year 2001 and earlier, the CPS ASEC allowed respondents to report only one race group.",,,,,,,,,,,,
25 Black alone refers to people who reported Black and did not report any other race category.,,,,,,,,,,,,
26 Asian alone refers to people who reported Asian and did not report any other race category.,,,,,,,,,,,,
27 American Indian and Alaska Native alone refers to people who reported American Indian and Alaska Native and did not report any other race category.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"28 Since Hispanic individuals may be any race, data in this report for the Hispanic population overlap with data for race groups. Of those who reported only one race, Hispanic origin was reported by 16.7 percent of White householders, 5.9 percent of Black householders, 2.7 percent of Asian householders, and 33.4 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native householders. Data users should exercise caution when interpreting aggregate results for the Hispanic population or for race groups because these populations  onsist of many distinct groups that differ in socioeconomic characteristics, culture, and nativity. Data were first collected for Hispanic individuals in 1972 and for Asian and Pacific Islander and American Indian and Alaska Native individuals in 1987.
